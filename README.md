# Generating PWM Signals Using TCD with High-Frequency Input

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for TCD as described in [*TB3236 - Generating PWM Signals Using TCD with High-Frequency Input*](https://www.microchip.com/wwwappnotes/appnotes.aspx?appnote=en1001508) document from Microchip. The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution (*Generating_PWM_signals_using_TCD.atsln*) with two projects inside, one project for each illustrated use case.


Use cases:
1. TCD configured in One Ramp and using OSCHF as input frequency (*TCD_One_Ramp_OSCHF* project)
 - *Use case description:* The TCD will be initialized and configured to run in One Ramp mode, have the OSCHF as
input clock running at 24 MHz, and generate two PWM signals – WOA on the PA4 pin, and WOB on the PA5 pin. The
PWM signal on WOA will have a 25% duty cycle and the signal on WOB will have a 30% duty cycle.
 - *Result:* The TCD will generate one PWM signal with a 25% duty cycle on WOA (PA4 pin) and one PWM signal with a
30% duty cycle on WOB.
2. TCD configured in Two Ramp and using PLL (driven by OSCHF) as input frequency (*TCD_Two_Ramp_PLL* project)
 - *Use case description:* The TCD will be initialized and configured to run in Two Ramp mode, to have the PLL as
input clock running at 48 MHz, and to generate two PWM signals – WOA on the PA4 pin and WOB on the PA5 pin.
The PWM signal on WOA will have a 10% duty cycle and the signal on WOB (PA5 pin) will have a 20% duty cycle.
 - *Result:* The TCD will generate one PWM signal with a 10% duty cycle on WOA (the PA4 pin) and one PWM signal
with a 20% duty cycle on WOB
